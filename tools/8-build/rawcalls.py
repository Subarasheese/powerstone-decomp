"""rawcalls.py [--update] [--allow] [--list]: C that calls into code no function in functions.txt starts at.

Generated C sometimes reaches original code by a raw address: `((int (*)(int))(0xC0D40CC))(a4)`. equiv.py passes such a
function, since its simulator runs the original bytes at that address; but no C exists there, so a build from C (or the
native port) has nothing to call. The target is code functions.txt does not list (a missed function, or the rest of a
function whose recorded size is short) or the middle of a listed function (a shared tail).

The check is a ratchet: tests/rawcalls_allowed.txt lists the calls known when it was introduced (target, calling
function, file). A raw call to an unlisted address that is not on the list fails (exit 1): new C must not add any.
  --update   drop the entries that no longer occur (a fix removed them); never adds
  --allow    rewrite the list from what occurs now (adds too: only for a deliberate exception)
  --list     print every raw call into unlisted code, allowed or not

Run in the repo. Files whose first line is `/* @unit` (byte-matching units) are not read: their calls are the original's.
